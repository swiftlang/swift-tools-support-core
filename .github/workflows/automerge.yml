name: Create PR to merge release into main branch
# In the first period after branching the release branch,
# we typically want to include many changes from `main` in the release branch.
# This workflow automatically creates a PR to merge the release branch into the main.
# Later in the release cycle we should stop this practice to avoid landing risky changes by disabling this workflow.
# To do so, disable the workflow as described in https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow
