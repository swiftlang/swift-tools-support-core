 This file contains temporary shim functions for use during the adoption of
 AbsolutePath and RelativePath.  The eventual plan is to use the FileSystem
 API for all of this, at which time this file will go way.  But since it is
 important to have a quality FileSystem API, we will evolve it slowly.

 Meanwhile this file bridges the gap to let call sites be as clean as possible,
 while making it fairly easy to find those calls later.
